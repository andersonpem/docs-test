# Test Project documentation

Hello there. I'm a shiny documentation repo. How's that? :)

It seems GitHub only allows the docs folder from the branch **Master** to be used. OR the gh-pages one. How cool is that? :)

Well, now I can choose.

Personally I'm rather separate the branches. Code for code. Docs for docs.
